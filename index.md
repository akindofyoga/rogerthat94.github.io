## About
I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I have the privilege of being advised by [Professor Satya](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include mobile systems and edge computing. I am fortunate enough to be funded by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](http://nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"}.
